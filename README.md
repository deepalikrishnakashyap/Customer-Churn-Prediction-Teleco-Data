Customer Churn Prediction: Linear Regression vs Random Forest

Overview

Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to retain customers and minimize revenue loss. This project applies machine learning techniques to predict churn and compares the performance of two models: Linear Regression and Random Forest.

Project Steps

# Step 1: Define Business Problem

The goal is to predict customer churn based on historical data and identify key factors contributing to churn. The insights can help businesses implement proactive customer retention strategies.

# Step 2: Data Understanding and Preprocessing

Load the dataset containing customer details, service usage, and tenure.

Handle missing values and outliers.

Encode categorical features.

Scale numerical features for model compatibility.

# Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize churn distribution.

Analyze correlations between features.

Compare distributions of key variables for churned vs. retained customers.

# Step 4: Feature Engineering

Select relevant features for modeling.

Create new features if necessary.

Transform data for optimal model performance.

# Step 5: Build Machine Learning Models

Train Linear Regression to establish a baseline model.

Train Random Forest to capture complex relationships in the data.

Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Step 6: Results â€“ Interpretation of Feature Importance Output

Compare feature importance from both models.

Analyze coefficients from Linear Regression and feature importances from Random Forest.

Derive actionable insights for customer retention strategies.

# Technologies Used

Python
